NAME

    Log::Any::Adapter::OpenTracing - Log::Any support for OpenTracing spans

SYNOPSIS

     use OpenTracing::DSL qw(:v1);
     use Log::Any qw($log);
     use Log::Any::Adapter qw(OpenTracing);
     trace {
      $log->info('Messages in a span should be logged');
     };
     $log->info('Messages outside a span would not be logged');

DESCRIPTION

    This Log::Any::Adapter implementation provides support for log messages
    attached to OpenTracing::Span instances.

    It's most likely to be useful in conjunction with
    Log::Any::Adapter::Multiplexor, so that you keep STDERR/file logging
    and augment spans whenever they are active.
